# VirtualPet_4
In Class 38, you have created a layout for a multiplayer car racing game in the databases, created a game state, and displayed the scoreboard with all the players along with a score based upon the distance covered. In this project, you will apply the concepts learned in class and complete the virtual pet app's creation.
